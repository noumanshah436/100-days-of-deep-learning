Multi-head Attention enhances the expressiveness and representational capacity of Transformers by allowing the model to attend to different parts of the input data simultaneously. By utilizing multiple attention heads, the model can capture diverse patterns and relationships in the data, enabling more effective information processing and feature extraction. This mechanism enhances the model's ability to handle complex sequences and tasks in natural language processing and other domains.
